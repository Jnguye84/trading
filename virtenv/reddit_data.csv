I think having the Exparel helped a lot so I would definitely recommend it for anyone on the fence.  Pics are before, day 2po and today.",47

"3","Im high on pain meds so please excuse any weird typos or wording 

I had my hysterectomy for the following reasons: heavy painful periods, requiring blood transfusions due to amount of bleeding, needed permanent 100% fool proof birth control due to me passing down a very rare genetic disease. 

The surgery was this morning at 7am. I wish I could say I had a completely good experience but unfortunately the hospital Im at is a total fucking shitshow. My surgeon and anesthesiologist and OR nurses were incredible but the preop and postop nurses are complete and total shit and Im in complete shock about what happened. 

I got out of the OR at 10. Anesthesiologist gave me pain meds when I woke up. All was well. Fast forward to 11am. Pain meds starting to wear off. I ask nurses for pain meds. They said the doctor hadnt put in any orders because I was supposed to go home but the surgery was more extensive than originally planned so Im being admitted. They told me he was in another surgery and when he was done with the surgery he would put the orders in. Ok fair enough. They told me he was almost done, maybe about thirty minutes left. 

12pm I call the nurse and ask if he has put the order in. She says no. 

12:45pm I call again and ask if he put the order in. She says no again. 

1:30pm I call again and she said no orders for pain meds were placed. 

I call the doctors office myself at 1:45pm and explain the situation. The office tells me hes at lunch now and they will leave a message for him. 

By 2pm Im in so much pain I am hysterically sobbing. I just had major surgery and NO PAIN MEDS. 

I call the call light again and the nurse tells me the doctor put in orders for a medication for bladder spasms but not for any morphine or dilaudid. 

At 2:15pm my surgeon walks in to my room after hearing me wailing down the hall. He asks whats going on and I tell him Im in so much pain I cant stand it. He asks me why I didnt ask the nurse for meds. I told him she told me he didnt put in any orders. WELL TURNS OUT HE DID. HOURS AGO. 

Why the nurse kept telling me no orders were placed I have absolutely no fucking idea. Why she saw the order for the bladder spasm medication and not the dilaudid I have no idea.  I am extraordinarily pissed off. I cannot fucking believe this happened. I plan to file a complaint. This was beyond unacceptable. 


One good thing that I encourage everyone to ask their surgeon about - exparel. This is a long lasting local anesthetic, it lasts about three days. My surgeon put it in all of my incision sites. It has worked so well to help with pain management. When I was sobbing and hyperventilating I didnt feel a thing at my incision sites. My surgeon had to straight up tell me that I couldnt feel it but I was close to ripping my incisions open and to calm down immediately so that wouldnt happen. Like thats how good this medicine is!!!! Make sure you ask your doctors about exparel for the incision sites. Im a huge fan. 

My bladder was adhered significantly to my uterus. I have been having urinary retention and hesitation since I was in college. No one has ever been able to figure out why. Well now we know!!!!! Surgeon said it took him a very long time to remove it because it was stuck on so tightly, it was completely adhered. 

I am hopeful that now I will be able to urinate better and also have less painful sex. Maybe Ill even get pleasure out of sex now that this has been fixed&.. what I would give to actually enjoy having sex with my husband&. Ive done pelvic floor physical therapy and surgical procedures to try and fix my painful sex problem and nothing has worked. Im really really REALLY hoping that this was the fix I needed. 

Im spending the night in the hospital due to the surgery being more extensive than originally planned. We have three children on life support. Im sad I wont be able to tuck them in bed tonight. I feel very guilty as my eldest has severe autism and hates any change in routine. Its going to mess her up emotionally and I cant shake the guilty feeling. I feel bad for my husband who will have to solo caretake. Ive done it before and solo caretaking THREE small children with special needs is extraordinarily difficult. But hey if I no longer have pain with sex I think I know a way to make up for it for my husband ;)

UPDATE: doctor told me he ordered a medication for breakthrough pain. So I got my pain meds finally from the lazy nurse and I was still having pain so I asked for the additional med and she told me that because I was about to go upstairs and get admitted that the nurse up there could give it instead. So I had to wait 1.5 hours to get upstairs and get pain meds because this bitch couldnt be bothered to do it herself. I was way too tired and in too much pain to fight and I was dizzy and my brain feels like mush so I didnt even fight back. I just said ok. But I just talked to my surgeon who said he will contact the nurse manager over the surgery department and tell her what happened. Im in fucking shock at the laziness and audacity of this bitch.

"4","I thought long and hard about writing this. Whiles going through this journey, there has been very limited information and/advice. So I've decided, hey, if this can help one person it's worth writing.

Why surgery? 
After a colonoscopy I found out I had 3 grade 3 and 4 internal hemerrhoids. Keep in mind, I've not had any pain or issues for years, aside from the occasional bloody stool. I had really bad episodes when I was in high school 30 years ago, but nothing recently. My surgeon said if I did t remove them it could be a huge issue whe. I get older, into my 60s though 80s. So we scheduled my surgery on 11/10/23. 

Pre Op
Once I was committed to the surgery,  I did what everyone else would and went down a rabbit hole. A few things were clear. #1 It was going to be a very painful surgery. #2 Sounds like the first post op bowel movement would be hell. #3 If you don't drink a ton of water, you'll pay dearly during a BM. #4 Take in a fair amount of fiber. #5 Be ready to run to the bathroom with a moments notice. #6 You will leak, and its not a big deal. #7 Buy Smooth Move Tea! It's a must. Drink it everyday. 

Must do - pre op
So, I made sure the morning before surgery that I only had a liquid diet. I also made sure I emptied myself out that night. I scheduled my surgery on a Friday (it was a option) so I could then take 2 full weeks off, and 3 weekends (17 days in total). Bought gauze pads, Tucks wipes, A&amp;D ointment, and Miralax. We already had bidets installed in all our bathrooms (If at all possible, GWT A BIDET!!). We have warm water bidets that ended up being a life saver throuout this process. 

Day of surgery 
Surgery went well. Doctor said he removed 3 internals and 2 external tags. He also said he gave me a local anesthetic Exparel (a local that lasts from 48 to 72 hour post op). I felt great! Literally no pain at all. Only a weird feeling of numbness down there. I did feel tired, and just laid down.

Day 3
First 2 days were the same. Day 3 the numbness 100% wore off, but the pain was more like pressure and slightly sore. I started taking the Oxy and Colace (stool softener), along with Miralax in anticipation of a BM. Late in the day I felt the urge to have a BM so I tried and a real tiny slither came out, and it felt like fire and hurt about an 8/10. As soon as i went, i used the bidet, tux wipes, then jumped in a hot bath. That was so much relief i couldnt believe it. I was like, that hurt but wasn't that bad! I spoke too soon.  

Day 4 - The toughest day
Around 3pm I felt a serious urge to go. One thing you will learn is the urge to go happens with a moments notice. I went and sat down and resisted the urge to push. The pain was out of this world!! I'd say 11/10. It felt like a square peg was trying to get through a circle. Then once the firm piece came out the soft stuff did. A lot of it!! I almost passed out. Used the bidet and jumped in the hot tub for 30 minutes. But I got through it! So will you.

Day 5 through 10
Overall it really wasn't bad. The ONlY challenge was the bowel movements. I would have to go 2 to 4 times a day. The pain was about 8/10. It was a burning and severe stinging pain that would make me not totally empty out, then have to come back. Each time jumping into the hot bath for immediate relief. The tub will become your best friend. 

You will need to place gauze folded in half between your cheeks to absorb the leaking. Our bodies are mostly water, so like with a road rash, fluid comes to surface as you heal. This will make you feel like your crack is sweaty if you don't. 

Day 11 through 17
Healing,  just dealing with painful BMs. Your anus is constantly opening and closing when you go, and you're still healing inside as well as outside. So it's going to sting. In some cases, the stinging can be an 8/10. So Do Not eat anything spicy at all. Sitting was okay, and I went back to working (from home) sitting on a pillow. I still hadn't driven yet though. 

Day 18 through 28 (3-4 weeks)
Feel great, once again, except for the painful BMs. Less frequency, but figured out to eat fiber, drink a lot of water (half you body weight in oz), fruits (an apple, banana,  and prune). With oatmeal in the morning. Stoped taking  Colace, but drinking 1 cup of smooth move tea and Miralax. BMs felt like lava 8/10. 

Week 5 
I traveled. Had a business trip and flew cross country. Didn't go for 2 days and paid dearly for it. Had anxiety about having an urge on the plane, but that never happened. No major leaking either. The 3rd day when I finally had a BM it was painful, but more like a 7/10.

** Eureka moment 
Figured out this week that most of the burning came when I overdid the laxative and had diarrhea (its acidic and burns like hell). So the idea is to have a balance of just enough to make your stool soft but not runny!! 

Week 6
Had my post op doctor visit yesterday (day 42). Surgeon said everything looks good, and I'm healing internally as well as externally.  But it will take 2 more weeks to fully heal. He said I was right, and that the reason for the burning is partially the healing, but mainly the excessive laxatives. So only eat enough fiber to soften the BMs. He said I'll feel healing improvement every 3 days. 

For the past 5 days, knock on wood, I've felt great, and BMs have been 3/10! Im barely leaking at all now, but he said as I heal it is just part of theprocrss for the next 2 weeks. 

You can do this!! Yes, it's a painful surgery! But  you shouldn't have to suffer with the bleeding and pain of hemerrhoids. You can get through this, and you will! The first 4-7 days are awful, but time will pass really fast. 

Do
- Prepare yourself for a tough first 5 days.
- Know that you will get through this (its only a week)  
- Yes, your first BM will be hell, so stay hydrated, eat your fiber, and resist to push

Don't 
- eat heavy or greasy foods like burger, steaks, or pizza for a week
- take  too many  laxatives 
- allow yourself to get dehydrated 

I hope this helps. This surgery is no joke,  but you can, and you will get through it.",15

"6","Hello everyone 
First Id like to say thank you to everyone who has helped answer my questions. This community has been extremely helpful and I truly appreciate you all. 
Im 3dpo and was wanted to know if you guys can shine some light this way. I had major muscle repair and have been walking since day one but of course get winded and am obviously not my normal self. So I take it easy. I just feel like what day will this walking improve and at what day did you all start to gain more strength. I know everyone is different but hearing others experiences helps. I had a drainless TT + MR + Lipo to flanks and lateral chest. U also used exparel. 

Also when were you all sitting at table eating without legs upright. I still eat with my legs elevated. Thx again everyone",8
"7","Any one using exparel for interscalene blocks?

Last i checked the studies werent super convincing when compared to ropi/bupi plus decadron",8
"8","Has anyone gotten the Exparel shot? My surgery is in a few days, I have elected to take it as my PS offered it with a cost. Just wondering if anyone has experience with it and has it helped ease the recovery d>y",7
"9","Hi Im on day 6 after my two bottom wisdom teeth were removed. One had erupted and one was impacted. I received the Exparel shot and had almost zero pain the first 3 days. On day 4 I could tell when I was getting close to my next 600 mg Ibuprofen dosage do to slight pain. Day 4 night, I would wake up from pain when it was time to take it. Day 5 (yesterday) I start alternating between acetaminophen and ibuprofen, but neither was lastjng the full duration. On the side that had the impacted wisdom tooth it started hurting pretty bad last night. I finally dipped into the Percocets to sleep. However, it only reduced the pain to about half. Today i woke up in less pain than last night and am back to taking only the Ibuprofen. However, after gently swishing the prescribed mouthwash, a black chuck came out. I still see a clot but there was some slight bleeding. Am I having dry socket? If I do would the pain start decreasing like it is or is it about to come back worse? I am very scared and have done everything exactly by the books. I still have not even had a bite of solid food. Please give me words of encouragement. 30F, no smoking, no birth control, no straws, straight liquid diet, no irrigating.",2
"10","Hi guys! I couldn't find answers for my specific question anywhere else, so I thought I'd try here!

Context: 29 F, all 4 wisdom teeth removed on 12/28 @ 9AM. Top 2 were simple extractions (erupted, grew normally), bottom 2 were partially erupted and impacted. I opted for Exparel, PRF, IV sedation. Minimal swelling and pain so far. I've been applying ice on and off.I've been eating soft foods (yogurt, ice cream, mashed potatoes, miso soup (just the broth and diced tofu), jello.

Problem: Numbness started wearing off around the evening of day 1. Slight throbbing, but nothing too bad on day 2. This morning, I noticed that my right cheek was slightly numb. I didn't think much of it, but as the day goes on, it seems to be getting worse. I can still feel temperature and touch on the outside of my cheek (my face), but the inside of my mouth and the right side of my lips are numb, almost like it was when I first got out of the operating room. I don't feel any throbbing pain, just some soreness in my lower jaws, but nothing some Tylenol can't fix. What's freaking me out is that **the numbness went away but is now back**. Is this normal?

Did anyone experience something similar to this? I'm holding back on contacting the oral surgeon in case this is a side-effect of the Exparel or the IV sedation. Or could it be the slight swelling that's pressing down on a nerve? The surgeon didn't mention anything about nerve damage.

Any insight or anecdote would be greatly appreciated!",1
"11","So I need to have 2 wisdom teeth removed on the top due to crowding. Oral surgeon office called and gave estimate of $600 for partially bony and $800 for fully bony + $300 for exparel drug. They said insurance covers everything at 60% and doesn't cover exparel at all. I advised them that anesthesia should be covered at 100% and I should have a copay of just $100 for exparel and asked for an itemized estimate to get full understanding. They said I can see the estimate the morning of surgery. Is this shady or am I just overthinking it? I had my dentist try to charge me a $600 estimate for a crown and when I went over the allowable charges per my insurance, they happily let me pay $300 and ended up refunding me $50 that I overpaid later on.
Not really wanting to overpay a ton just before Christmas to have to wait for a refund after it's billed.",1

"13","hello! I got my (very impacted) wisdom teeth extracted and was super nervous &amp; had looked here for any guidance so figured Id pay it forward and do a week review in case anyone wanted it :) 

Day of surgery: took a little over an hour and I woke up fine from the IV anesthetic. No loopyness. Oral surgeon mentioned to my mom that I burnt off the novocaine quickly and needed more than they anticipated. A lot of bleeding after but stopped within a couple hours. Pain, obviously &amp; my lip/chin area was totally numbed. Slept propped up &amp; on my back. Only had ice pops and maybe a squeeze yogurt. Swollen but no bruising. Ice pack was my bestie. 

Day 1 post: numbness in lip wore off over night. Excruciating pain honestly. Paid extra for exparel (slow release anesthetic) and it did not work for me. Super nauseated couldnt take my pain meds even. Had maybe a few spoonfuls of soup. Ice pack constantly. Just not a good day lol 

Day 2-4: slow but noticeable improvements each day. Still a lot of pain and not chewing things. Day 2 switched to an OTC pain med (Motrin dual bc combo is best for teeth pain) bc the prescription made me nauseated. Hot salt water rinses 3 times a day. Still icepack every so often ! 

Day 5-6: back to work. Mostly just sore. Still only eating soft foods. Mostly hurts in morning because Im a side sleeper despite best efforts. I do have a little blood in my mouth in mornings. Swelling gone. Still not using straws. 
 
Day 7: follow up appt. Doc says the clot healing is no longer something to worry about (no dry socket yay!) &amp; the dissolvable stitches are still there. No further appointments. Still cautious eating bc of pain but had a sandwich so chewing wasnt an issue anymore. 

Overall: for me, exparel was not worth it I know a lot of us burn anesthetic quickly so just putting it out there. Ice pack wrap super important. Ask for Zofran for nausea. Lost a noticeable amount of weight. Long story short it was a bad time but I survived :)",0

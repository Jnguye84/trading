"1","I thought long and hard about writing this. Whiles going through this journey, there has been very limited information and/advice. So I've decided, hey, if this can help one person it's worth writing.

Why surgery? 
After a colonoscopy I found out I had 3 grade 3 and 4 internal hemerrhoids. Keep in mind, I've not had any pain or issues for years, aside from the occasional bloody stool. I had really bad episodes when I was in high school 30 years ago, but nothing recently. My surgeon said if I did t remove them it could be a huge issue whe. I get older, into my 60s though 80s. So we scheduled my surgery on 11/10/23. 

Pre Op
Once I was committed to the surgery,  I did what everyone else would and went down a rabbit hole. A few things were clear. #1 It was going to be a very painful surgery. #2 Sounds like the first post op bowel movement would be hell. #3 If you don't drink a ton of water, you'll pay dearly during a BM. #4 Take in a fair amount of fiber. #5 Be ready to run to the bathroom with a moments notice. #6 You will leak, and its not a big deal. #7 Buy Smooth Move Tea! It's a must. Drink it everyday. 

Must do - pre op
So, I made sure the morning before surgery that I only had a liquid diet. I also made sure I emptied myself out that night. I scheduled my surgery on a Friday (it was a option) so I could then take 2 full weeks off, and 3 weekends (17 days in total). Bought gauze pads, Tucks wipes, A&amp;D ointment, and Miralax. We already had bidets installed in all our bathrooms (If at all possible, GWT A BIDET!!). We have warm water bidets that ended up being a life saver throuout this process. 

Day of surgery 
Surgery went well. Doctor said he removed 3 internals and 2 external tags. He also said he gave me a local anesthetic Exparel (a local that lasts from 48 to 72 hour post op). I felt great! Literally no pain at all. Only a weird feeling of numbness down there. I did feel tired, and just laid down.

Day 3
First 2 days were the same. Day 3 the numbness 100% wore off, but the pain was more like pressure and slightly sore. I started taking the Oxy and Colace (stool softener), along with Miralax in anticipation of a BM. Late in the day I felt the urge to have a BM so I tried and a real tiny slither came out, and it felt like fire and hurt about an 8/10. As soon as i went, i used the bidet, tux wipes, then jumped in a hot bath. That was so much relief i couldnt believe it. I was like, that hurt but wasn't that bad! I spoke too soon.  

Day 4 - The toughest day
Around 3pm I felt a serious urge to go. One thing you will learn is the urge to go happens with a moments notice. I went and sat down and resisted the urge to push. The pain was out of this world!! I'd say 11/10. It felt like a square peg was trying to get through a circle. Then once the firm piece came out the soft stuff did. A lot of it!! I almost passed out. Used the bidet and jumped in the hot tub for 30 minutes. But I got through it! So will you.

Day 5 through 10
Overall it really wasn't bad. The ONlY challenge was the bowel movements. I would have to go 2 to 4 times a day. The pain was about 8/10. It was a burning and severe stinging pain that would make me not totally empty out, then have to come back. Each time jumping into the hot bath for immediate relief. The tub will become your best friend. 

You will need to place gauze folded in half between your cheeks to absorb the leaking. Our bodies are mostly water, so like with a road rash, fluid comes to surface as you heal. This will make you feel like your crack is sweaty if you don't. 

Day 11 through 17
Healing,  just dealing with painful BMs. Your anus is constantly opening and closing when you go, and you're still healing inside as well as outside. So it's going to sting. In some cases, the stinging can be an 8/10. So Do Not eat anything spicy at all. Sitting was okay, and I went back to working (from home) sitting on a pillow. I still hadn't driven yet though. 

Day 18 through 28 (3-4 weeks)
Feel great, once again, except for the painful BMs. Less frequency, but figured out to eat fiber, drink a lot of water (half you body weight in oz), fruits (an apple, banana,  and prune). With oatmeal in the morning. Stoped taking  Colace, but drinking 1 cup of smooth move tea and Miralax. BMs felt like lava 8/10. 

Week 5 
I traveled. Had a business trip and flew cross country. Didn't go for 2 days and paid dearly for it. Had anxiety about having an urge on the plane, but that never happened. No major leaking either. The 3rd day when I finally had a BM it was painful, but more like a 7/10.

** Eureka moment 
Figured out this week that most of the burning came when I overdid the laxative and had diarrhea (its acidic and burns like hell). So the idea is to have a balance of just enough to make your stool soft but not runny!! 

Week 6
Had my post op doctor visit yesterday (day 42). Surgeon said everything looks good, and I'm healing internally as well as externally.  But it will take 2 more weeks to fully heal. He said I was right, and that the reason for the burning is partially the healing, but mainly the excessive laxatives. So only eat enough fiber to soften the BMs. He said I'll feel healing improvement every 3 days. 

For the past 5 days, knock on wood, I've felt great, and BMs have been 3/10! Im barely leaking at all now, but he said as I heal it is just part of theprocrss for the next 2 weeks. 

You can do this!! Yes, it's a painful surgery! But  you shouldn't have to suffer with the bleeding and pain of hemerrhoids. You can get through this, and you will! The first 4-7 days are awful, but time will pass really fast. 

Do
- Prepare yourself for a tough first 5 days.
- Know that you will get through this (its only a week)  
- Yes, your first BM will be hell, so stay hydrated, eat your fiber, and resist to push

Don't 
- eat heavy or greasy foods like burger, steaks, or pizza for a week
- take  too many  laxatives 
- allow yourself to get dehydrated 

I hope this helps. This surgery is no joke,  but you can, and you will get through it.",14

"3","Hello everyone 
First Id like to say thank you to everyone who has helped answer my questions. This community has been extremely helpful and I truly appreciate you all. 
Im 3dpo and was wanted to know if you guys can shine some light this way. I had major muscle repair and have been walking since day one but of course get winded and am obviously not my normal self. So I take it easy. I just feel like what day will this walking improve and at what day did you all start to gain more strength. I know everyone is different but hearing others experiences helps. I had a drainless TT + MR + Lipo to flanks and lateral chest. U also used exparel. 

Also when were you all sitting at table eating without legs upright. I still eat with my legs elevated. Thx again everyone",9
"4","Any one using exparel for interscalene blocks?

Last i checked the studies werent super convincing when compared to ropi/bupi plus decadron",9
"5","Hi all! I am about 6 hours post op from drainless TT with lipo and maybe small amount of MR (never had kids), and a BA. 

So far Im feeling alright! Got the exparel shot so not in any pain unless I try to get up. Went to the bathroom once and it was easy breezy. 

Im standing up pretty straight but get dizzy after a minute or two of standing /walking. Ive probably had 100oz of liquid since I got home so hoping the dizziness subsides soon. Im assuming its from Oxys so I might try to switch to Tylenol sooner. 

My chest feels fine, been icing on and off and its just the tiniest bit sore. 

So thankful for this community and all the great knowledge you share!!",8
"6","Im 8dpo from a drainless TT + MR + lipo to flanks/lateral chest. I seen the doctor yesterday and was told incision was good and all was well. I began to tell him about the nerve pain (burning pain) at incision site. He said thats normal and I shouldnt worry. He prescribed me more gabapentin for the nerve pain. My question is how long do people stay on gabapentin post TT? 

I am no longer on pain meds only took three pills in total (exparel must have worked). I am now just taking Tylenol, arnica and just finishing the antibiotics. The gabapentin truly does help with relief to the burning pain I just dont want take it for too long.",7
